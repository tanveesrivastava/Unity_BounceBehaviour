# Unity_BounceBehaviour
Unity scene with primitive objects (Cube, Sphere, and Cylinder) and  assign distinct bounce behaviours to each object. Additional features, such as prefabs and  camera configuration, are also implemented as part of this project. 



# Unity Bounce Behavior Lab

## Overview
This repository contains the Unity Lab project demonstrating different bounce behaviors for primitive objects (Cube, Sphere, and Cylinder). The experiment showcases the use of physics materials to alter the bouncing properties of objects.

## Files
- **Lab Report (PDF):** A detailed explanation of the scene setup and bounce behaviors.
- **Recorded Video:** A demonstration of the scene in action.

## Features
- Configured Unity scene with primitive objects.
- Physics-based bounce behaviors for each shape.
- Prefabs created for future use.
- Additional assets integrated from the Unity Store.
